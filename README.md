# badmail
literally the worst mail app. please don't use this. passwords are stored in plaintext so anyone who looks at the file can get access to your email to, say, send everyone you know crypto scams

how to use (if you really want to)
- make auth.txt with following contents:
```"<your email>", <your password>"```

(hint for gmail users: use app password)
- profit????
